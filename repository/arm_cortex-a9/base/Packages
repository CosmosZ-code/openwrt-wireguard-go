Description: WireGuard is a novel VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It 
  aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while 
  avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more 
  performant than OpenVPN.  WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN 
  for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for 
  many different circumstances. It uses UDP.

  This package provides the official userspace implementation of WireGuard 
  plus `wg-go`, a userspace implementation of the control program `wg(8)`, 
  and the netifd protocol helper.
